            <p>Imagine you decided to build a house. It’s an important and complex task that requires planning, the involvement of various specialists, and constant quality control. The software development life cycle (SDLC) is very similar to the process of building a house—every stage is crucial, and at each stage, the tester, like a foreman, has a vital role.</p>
            <p><strong>Stage 1: Planning and Design.</strong><br> Before you start building a house, you need to create a blueprint that clearly specifies how many rooms there will be, what materials to use, and where the utilities will run. In programming, this stage determines what the software should do, what functions it will perform, and how it will interact with users. Testers here act as "checkers," thinking ahead: will the hallway be too narrow, or will the kitchen be inconvenient? They help anticipate potential problems to avoid them later on.</p>
            <p><strong>Stage 2: Laying the Foundation.</strong><br> Now the construction begins, and the first step is to lay a solid foundation. In programming, this means developing the main architecture of the application and writing the key code. Testers start their work here: they check how well the "foundation" of the program handles loads, whether there are any cracks, and if it is reliable. If something goes wrong at this stage, fixing it will be much more difficult and expensive later on.</p>
            <p><strong>Stage 3: Building the Frame and Internal Systems.</strong><br> The walls are up, the roof is on, but the house is far from finished. It’s time to install the electrical wiring, plumbing, and ventilation. In software, this is the moment when functions, interfaces, and integrations are added. Testers here are like electricians and plumbers, checking whether everything is connected correctly, ensuring there are no leaks, and making sure the lights work in every room. They meticulously inspect every detail to ensure the system operates as intended.</p>
            <p><strong>Stage 4: Finishing and Decoration.</strong><br> The house is almost ready; it’s time for the finishing touches: painting the walls, laying tiles, and arranging the furniture. In the programming world, this is the stage of refining interfaces, optimizing performance, and fixing minor bugs. Testers are once again at the forefront—they are like decorators ensuring that everything looks and works perfectly. They help make sure that the software is not only functional but also pleasant to use.</p>
            <p><strong>Stage 5: Move-In and Maintenance.</strong><br> The house is ready, and the residents begin to settle in. But even after construction is complete, there’s always a chance that something will need to be fixed: a door that doesn’t close properly or an outlet that doesn’t work. In programming, this is the support phase, where testers continue to monitor the software, fix new issues, and help adapt it to new conditions.</p>
            <p>All of this shows that software development is a complex and multifaceted process in which testers play a crucial role at every stage, like experienced builders who know that the quality and durability of the final product depend on their work. Just like a house, every software program requires attention to detail, testing, and constant improvement to serve its "residents"—the users—well and for a long time.</p>
